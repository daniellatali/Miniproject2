The following has been quotes by Albert Einstein himself:
(Don't look this up online trust us this is 100% factual and real.)

"Any intelligent fool can make things {adjective1}, more {adjective2}, and more violent.
It takes a touch of genius -- and a lot of {pluralnoun1} -- to move in the opposite {noun1}."

"Reality is merely a {noun2}, albeit a very {adjective3} one."

"Great {pluralnoun2} have often encountered violent opposition from weak {pluralnoun3}."

"Technological progress is like a {noun3} in the hands of a pathological {occ1}."

"No, this {noun4} won`t work... How on earth are you ever going to {verb1} in terms
of {subject1} and {subject2} so important a biological phenomenon as {adjective3} love?"

"The release of {noun5} power has changed everything except our way
of {verbing}... the solution to this problem lies in the {body} of mankind.
If only I had known, I should have become a {occ2}."
